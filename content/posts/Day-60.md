### Clearly there have been some large gaps in daily updates of late, and I'd like to take a moment to write about it.

I very much enjoyed going through some Youtube tutorials on decoupled Drupal.

After that I've tried to update my linux box to run Drupal locally, and that is a challenge to me.

So, here we are with just a status update. 

"I've been messing around with my local machine"

Not the most fun update ever, I'd much rather be focusing on building new things than troubleshooting user permissions or what have you.

Fingers crossed I'm nearly out of the woods, Drupal + Gatsby seems so exciting IRL.
