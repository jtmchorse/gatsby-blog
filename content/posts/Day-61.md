### Gatsby themes

Woo, finally something that isn't just me whining about how badly I've setup my linux box!

I've been going through the Gatsby theme authoring course on Egghead.io, instructed by Jason Lengstorf.

I'll freely admit that I've been far behind the yarn train, and setting up this project with yarn and then yarn workspaces has been interesting.

Aside from that, you can find the Repo for this course here [on github](https://github.com/jlengstorf/authoring-gatsby-themes) and a writeup here [on Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/building-a-theme/).
