###  Gatsby Tutorial part-two, css. Specifically{" "}

[#using-component-scoped-css](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/#using-component-scoped-css)
      
This example takes us through building a micro component, and giving it
some css. Not just any css file though, this is a .module.css file

Why is that special?
Component-scoped CSS
      
As the tutorial page describes, "CSS Modules are very popular because
they let you write CSS normally but with a lot more safety. The tool
automatically generates unique class and animation names, so you donâ€™t
have to worry about selector name collisions."
      
But why is that useful?
      
Lets take a look at our [container componet](/about-css-modules/) that we created in this section.

Nothing super fancy, obviously. But we can still use this to try and
learn what we should be here.

What is super neat here in the inspector is that we have unique
classnames for the component. According to the tutorial, by using the
css as a .module.css Gatsby will render components like this, all
bundled up as one little self contained thing. All so we don't have css
issues with other components. Thanks Obama.
      
      
This is just a simple example of course, I'm assuming that in the future
you can hold components inside other components and so on. Feels like
building any sort of not basic site would require that.
