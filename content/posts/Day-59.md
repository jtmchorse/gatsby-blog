### Drupal and Gatsby

I'm a huge fan of Jason Lengstorf and his public learning twitch stream and I was very excited to see him go through a Drupal + Gatsby show.

It has taken me several days to code along with this video, I'd like to blame it on my local machine but I managed to get there.

First things first we have to make a new Drupal site, usually easier said than done.

Setting up a Drupal sample site with Pantheon was terribly easy, I'd highly suggest it.

Setting up a Drupal site on your local machine... That is a slightly different story and I'll just leave it at that.
