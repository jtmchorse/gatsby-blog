### Cleanup time!

So far in this series there have been a few error _warnings_ in the project, so we've spent the day cleaning those up.

### Skipping some videos

I've setup several blog examples in Gatsby already, so I've decided to skip the newly added blog section of this class. Should I ever need to review it, this will be a great spot.


### Moving to Drupal

Starting tomorrow I'll be using this [YT series from Code Karate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WJ-_Ap-_48&list=PL-Ve2ZZ1kZNT9BhQMMI9jUySfdnQ8-S3n&index=2&t=0s) and [GatsbyGuides](https://gatsbyguides.com/) to start fleshing out my Drupal -> Gatsby knowledge.
